# Refactor Opportunities

After thoroughly reviewing the codebase, I'm impressed with the overall code quality and design! The implementation is well-structured and follows good practices. Here's my analysis:

## CLI Interface Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Clever `AutowtGroup` allowing `autowt <branch>` as shorthand for `autowt switch <branch>`
- Consistent option naming (`--debug`, `-y/--yes`, `--terminal`)
- Good help text and context settings
- Flexible terminal mode support (tab/window/inplace)

**Minor CLI Issues:**
- The `switch` command is redundant given the AutowtGroup functionality
- Could benefit from more examples in help text

## Code Quality Analysis

The code is **very well structured** with clear separation of concerns. Most functions are reasonably sized and focused. However, I found a few areas for improvement:

## Trouble Spots & Improvement Opportunities

### 1. **Long Functions Needing Refactoring**

**High Priority:**
- `cleanup_worktrees()` (cleanup.py:41-115) - 74 lines, handles too many responsibilities
- `_remove_worktrees_and_update_state()` (cleanup.py:244-318) - 74 lines, complex nested logic
- `checkout_branch()` (checkout.py:18-96) - 78 lines, would benefit from extracting logic

**Medium Priority:**
- `_simple_config_interface()` (config.py:38-99) - 61 lines, input validation loop
- `_open_generic_terminal()` (terminal.py:242-300) - 58 lines, platform-specific branching

### 2. **Early Return Opportunities**

Several functions could benefit from early returns to reduce nesting:

**terminal.py:59-72** - Switch statement could use early returns:
```python
# Current nested approach
if mode == TerminalMode.INPLACE:
    return self._change_directory_inplace(worktree_path, init_script)
elif mode == TerminalMode.TAB:
    return self._switch_to_existing_or_new_tab(...)
elif mode == TerminalMode.WINDOW:
    return self._switch_to_existing_or_new_window(...)
else:
    logger.error(f"Unknown terminal mode: {mode}")
    return False
```

### 3. **Complex Nested Logic**

**cleanup.py:266-287** - Deeply nested branch deletion logic could be flattened:
```python
# Current deeply nested structure
if successfully_removed_branches:
    should_delete_branches = auto_confirm
    if not auto_confirm:
        # ... more nesting
        if should_delete_branches:
            # ... even more nesting
```

### 4. **Error Handling Patterns**

Some functions mix error handling styles. Consider standardizing on early returns for error cases.

## Specific Recommendations

### 1. **Refactor `cleanup_worktrees()`**
```python
def cleanup_worktrees(mode, services, dry_run=False, auto_confirm=False):
    # Early validation
    repo_path = git_service.find_repo_root()
    if not repo_path:
        print("Error: Not in a git repository")
        return
    
    # Extract smaller functions:
    # - _fetch_and_analyze_branches()
    # - _select_and_confirm_cleanup()
    # - _execute_cleanup()
```

### 2. **Simplify Terminal Mode Switching**
```python
def switch_to_worktree(self, worktree_path, mode, session_id=None, init_script=None, branch_name=None, auto_confirm=False):
    if mode == TerminalMode.INPLACE:
        return self._change_directory_inplace(worktree_path, init_script)
    
    if mode == TerminalMode.TAB:
        return self._switch_to_existing_or_new_tab(worktree_path, session_id, init_script, branch_name, auto_confirm)
    
    if mode == TerminalMode.WINDOW:
        return self._switch_to_existing_or_new_window(worktree_path, session_id, init_script, branch_name, auto_confirm)
    
    logger.error(f"Unknown terminal mode: {mode}")
    return False
```

### 3. **Extract Branch Deletion Logic**
```python
def _delete_local_branches(self, branches, auto_confirm):
    if not branches:
        return 0
    
    if not auto_confirm:
        if not self._confirm_branch_deletion(branches):
            print("Skipped branch deletion.")
            return 0
    
    return self._execute_branch_deletion(branches)
```

### 4. **Standardize Error Handling**
```python
def create_worktree(self, repo_path, branch, worktree_path):
    if not self._check_local_branch_exists(repo_path, branch):
        if not self._check_remote_branch_exists(repo_path, branch):
            return self._create_from_default_branch(repo_path, branch, worktree_path)
        return self._create_from_remote_branch(repo_path, branch, worktree_path)
    
    return self._create_from_local_branch(repo_path, branch, worktree_path)
```

## Overall Assessment

**The code is in excellent shape for an initial release!** The main improvements are about maintainability and readability rather than correctness. The architecture is sound, error handling is comprehensive, and the user experience is well thought out.

**Priority for initial release:**
1. Consider removing the redundant `switch` command (low risk)
2. The current code is perfectly functional as-is
3. Refactoring can be done post-release for maintainability

The codebase demonstrates strong Python practices, good separation of concerns, and thoughtful error handling. Well done!
