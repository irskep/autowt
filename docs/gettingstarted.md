# Getting Started with autowt

This guide will walk you through installing `autowt`, setting it up for a project, and using its core features to streamline your development workflow.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

*   **Python 3.10+**: You can check your version with `python3 --version`.
*   **Git 2.5+**: `autowt` relies on modern git worktree functionality. Check your version with `git --version`. Git 2.5 was released in 2015, so this shouldnâ€™t be a problem.
*   **A supported terminal (recommended)**: For the best experience, use a terminal with good tab and window management, like iTerm2 on macOS. See the [Terminal Support](terminalsupport.md) page for more details.

## Installation

### Pip

First, `pip install autowt`.  To verify the installation, run `autowt` to show the current state:

```txt
Primary clone: ~/dev/my-project
You are in: main clone

Branches:

Use 'autowt <branch>' to switch to a worktree or create a new one.
```

### Mise

You can install autowt in its own virtualenv with Mise and pipx:

```bash
mise use -g pipx:autowt
```

### uvx

If you have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed, you can invoke autowt without a separate install step via `uvx`:

```bash
uvx autowt
```

## Your First Worktree

Let's dive in and see `autowt` in action.

### Step 1: Create a New Feature Branch

Navigate to the root of any git repository you're working on. For this example, let's say your project is located at `~/dev/my-project`.

```bash
cd ~/dev/my-project
```

Now, let's create a worktree for a new feature.

```bash
autowt new-feature
```

Hereâ€™s what `autowt` does behind the scenes:

1.  Fetches the latest changes from your remote repository.
2.  Creates a new directory for your worktree at `../my-project-worktrees/new-feature/`.
3.  Creates a new git worktree for the `new-feature` branch. If the branch doesn't exist, it will be created from your main branch.
4.  Opens a new terminal tab or window and navigates to the new worktree directory.

You now have a clean, isolated environment for your new feature, without disturbing the main branch.

### Step 2: List Your Worktrees

To see an overview of your worktrees, use the `ls` command:

```bash
autowt ls
```

The output will look something like this:

```
Primary clone: ~/dev/my-project
You are in: new-feature

Branches:
new-feature      ~/dev/my-project-worktrees/new-feature ðŸ’»
main             ~/dev/my-project
```

The `ðŸ’»` icon indicates that you have an active terminal session for that worktree.

!!! info

    `autowt` with no arguments is an alias for `autowt ls`.

## A Typical Workflow

Now that you have the basics down, let's walk through a common development scenario.

### Juggling Multiple Tasks

Imagine you're working on `new-feature` when you get a request for an urgent bug fix. With `autowt`, you don't need to stash your changes. Just create a new worktree for the hotfix:

```bash
autowt hotfix/urgent-bug
```

A new terminal session opens for the bug fix. You can now work on the fix without affecting your `new-feature` branch. Once you're done, you can easily switch back:

```bash
autowt new-feature
```

`autowt` will switch you to the existing terminal session for `new-feature`, and you can pick up right where you left off.

### Cleaning Up

Once your `hotfix/urgent-bug` branch is merged and no longer needed, you can clean it up.

First, use the `--dry-run` flag to see what `autowt` will do:

```bash
autowt cleanup --dry-run
```

This will show you a list of branches that are safe to remove. When you're ready, run the command without the flag:

```bash
autowt cleanup
```

`autowt` will remove the worktree and, if the branch is merged, will also offer to delete the local git branch.
